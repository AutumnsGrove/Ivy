# Papercuts

Audit log of the commit-by-commit review of `aa0e438` (Add Go module and two-database store)
through `a049bfb` (Record chunk 2c complete and resume at 2d). One entry per issue found; each is
fixed in its own commit on the review branch unless marked **open**.

Entry format: `#N` · commit under review · file · severity · what was wrong · how it was fixed.

Severity: **bug** (wrong behaviour), **risk** (works today, fails under a plausible condition),
**standards** (violates CLAUDE.md or `docs/STANDARDS.md`), **nit** (clarity or consistency).

## Baseline (before the per-commit pass)

Starting state at `a049bfb`: `go build`, `go vet`, `staticcheck` and `gofumpt -l` are clean, and
the suite passes with `CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -race`.

- **#1** · baseline · `Makefile`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `docs/STANDARDS.md`, `docs/CI.md` ·
  **bug** · `make test` and the CI `go` job ran `CGO_ENABLED=0 go test -race ./...`. Go refuses
  that combination on Linux (`go: -race requires cgo`), so the test step could never pass, locally
  or in CI. Fix: run the race pass with `CGO_ENABLED=1` and say why in the Makefile, CI and docs.
  The "pure Go" guarantee is unchanged, because the `CGO_ENABLED=0` build, the arm64 cross-compile
  and the `nocgo` dependency check still gate it.


## `aa0e438` Add Go module and two-database store

- **#2** · `aa0e438` · `store/store.go` · **bug** · `openDB` built the DSN as `"file:" + path`.
  SQLite parses it as a URI, so a data dir containing `?`, `#` or `%` was truncated or decoded
  into a different path and the databases were created somewhere else. Found with a failing test
  (`TestOpenHandlesURIMetacharactersInPath`); fixed by escaping the path.
- **N1 (open, design)** · `aa0e438` · `store/store.go` · **risk** · STANDARDS.md asks for one
  serialized write connection plus a reader pool, but `Open` returns one unbounded `*sql.DB` per
  file with deferred transactions. Nothing opens a multi-statement write transaction yet (all
  writes are single statements, covered by `busy_timeout`), so it cannot fail today. The first
  transaction that reads and then writes, run beside another writer, will get `SQLITE_BUSY`
  without any retry. Decide the writer model (a `_txlock=immediate` write handle with
  `SetMaxOpenConns(1)`, plus a read handle) before the first such transaction lands in chunk 3.
